License

This software is meant for demonstration purposes only. There is no actual cannabis for sale
in this app! I wrote this software while residing in the state of California, where cannabis is legal.
Cannabis remains illegal in most of the rest of the world. Commercial usage (anything involving the sale or
distrubution of real cannabis) of this software in any area of the world where cannabis is illegal is
strictly forbidden. Use of this software in any manner that violates the laws of the region where this software is used
is strictly prohibited. Again, this software is for demonstration purposes only!
